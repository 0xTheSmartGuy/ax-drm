# AX-drm
[Its not your piracy which is bad but your purracy]

The first open-source DRM on Github.... 

It is written in python 


As a shield 🛡️ against piracy...........................................

You can modify file 'hack' (write some python for the payload) to make a litta punishment 💣

Notice: If i put the 1159731.jpg file it's for default payload

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How it works

Start drmserver.py using 'python3 drmserver.py &'

then start drmexample.py, type 44559999 as serial key, did it activate the payload?

If no then that's normal because it's the correct serial key

Else it means there are some errors (i tested the DRM actually)

- drmserver.py: DRM server
- AX_DRM.py : python module

Now try to start again drmserver.py then drmexample.py but type 'lutris', it must activate the payload 🇲🇦

Then voilà!!!!!!!
